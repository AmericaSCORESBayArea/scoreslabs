### What We Need

#### We need Documentation as well as Design and Code
Most of our projects start as needs in our communities and program. Scores program leaders and coaches are trained problem-solvers, so often the solutions start there.
### Documentation Contributions
##### Observation of Need
Documentation starts with an observation of need, followed by a process of temporary and experimental solutions...
#### Explorations, Prototypes, Research
We don't often have time for _analysis paralysis_ but we do have the capacity to try things out. The readiness and passion for collaboration among our coaches means they are prepared to test and give feedback on products and ideas from a very early stage. Remember, coaches are instinctive designers who are also trained observers of human behavior. They will know right away when something is working or when a design is not intuitive, and they will provide professional, unfiltered feedback.
This is why we call the spawning and testing of projects *Scores Labs*.
##### Explorations: Designs, Examples, Disposable Experiments
* _Designs_ are needed to express solutions that developers as well as stakeholders (users) can understand and work with. When a Scores Labs project says `Needs Design` that means a statement of need and/or a user story has been created but there is not enough yet for an interested developer to move forward. This could be provided in an analytical narrative, wireframe describing flow and/or user interface, architecture diagram, or an algorithm/process, like a recipe.
* _Examples_ may provide speedy solutions or ideas already out there. We encourage people to find solid, working technology, especially open source, that can be emulated or integrated. It's even better when leveraging an open source component provides opportunity for improvement and visiblity to that source project as well as our own.
* _Experiments_ are prototypes that can be applied to the need to gather more factual requirements, determine boundary conditions, weaknesses and strengths in the proposed technology. A good experiment will have an hypothesis and clear instructions for how the experiment should be conducted. It's possible that the Scores Labs team will be live-testing an experiment you propose and create, so help us maximize the learnings and opportunity for success.

### :mega: Discussions
Use discussions to collaborate with other contributors

### :beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://github.com/AmericaSCORESBayArea/scoreslabs/issues) are used to track issues that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the content or a repo that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/AmericaSCORESBayArea/scoreslabs/issuess/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request] [document needed] is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be deployed to the live site within 24 hours. :earth_africa: To learn more about opening a pull request in this repo, see [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request) below.

### :question: Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with GitHub, unrelated to our documentation, please [contact GitHub Support directly](https://support.github.com/contact). Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact GitHub Support, then closed and locked.

If you're having trouble with your GitHub account, contact [Support](https://support.github.com/contact).

### :earth_asia: Translations

This website is internationalized and available in multiple languages. The source content in this repository is written in English. We integrate with an external localization platform called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) and work with professional translators to localize the English content.

**We do not currently accept contributions for translated content**, but we hope to in the future.

### :balance_scale: Site Policy
GitHub's site policies are published on docs.github.com, too!

If you find a typo in the site policy section, you can open a pull request to fix it. For anything else, see [the CONTRIBUTING guide in the site-policy repo](https://github.com/github/site-policy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Starting with an issue
You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!

### Labels
Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.
- The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- The [`content` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acontent) is for problems or updates in the content on docs.github.com. These will usually require some knowledge of Markdown.
- The [`engineering` label](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aengineering) is for problems or updates in the docs.github.com website. These will usually require some knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js or YAML to fix.

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Working in the github/docs repository
Here's some information that might be helpful while working on a Docs PR:

- [Development](/contributing/development.md) - This short guide describes how to get this app running on your local machine.

- [Content markup reference](/contributing/content-markup-reference.md) - All of our content is written in GitHub-flavored Markdown, with some additional enhancements.

- [Content style guide for GitHub Docs](/contributing/content-style-guide.md) - This guide covers GitHub-specific information about how we style our content and images. It also links to the resources we use for general style guidelines.

- [Reusables](/data/reusables/README.md) - We use reusables to help us keep content up to date. Instead of writing the same long string of information in several articles, we create a reusable, then call it from the individual articles.

- [Variables](/data/variables/README.md) - We use variables the same way we use reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.

- [Liquid](/contributing/liquid-helpers.md) - We use liquid helpers to create different versions of our content.

- [Scripts](/script/README.md) - The scripts directory is the home for all of the scripts you can run locally.

- [Tests](/tests/README.md) - We use tests to ensure content will render correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it's also helpful to run them locally.

## Reviewing
We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Confirm that the changes address every part of the content design plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them).
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Review the entire pull request using the [localization checklist](contributing/localization-checklist.md).
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.
- [ ] Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
- [ ] Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull request template
When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
