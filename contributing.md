### What We Need
#### We need Documentation as well as Design and Code
Most of our projects start as needs in our communities and program. Scores program leaders and coaches are trained problem-solvers, so often the solutions start there.
### Documentation Contributions
##### Observation of Need
Documentation starts with an observation of need, followed by a process of temporary and experimental solutions...
#### Explorations, Prototypes, Research
We don't often have time for _analysis paralysis_ but we do have the capacity to try things out. The readiness and passion for collaboration among our coaches means they are prepared to test and give feedback on products and ideas from a very early stage. Remember, coaches are instinctive designers who are also trained observers of human behavior. They will know right away when something is working or when a design is not intuitive, and they will provide professional, unfiltered feedback.
This is why we call the spawning and testing of projects *Scores Labs*.
##### Explorations: Designs, Examples, Disposable Experiments
* _Designs_ are needed to express solutions that developers as well as stakeholders (users) can understand and work with. When a Scores Labs project says `Needs Design` that means a statement of need and/or a user story has been created but there is not enough yet for an interested developer to move forward. This could be provided in an analytical narrative, wireframe describing flow and/or user interface, architecture diagram, or an algorithm/process, like a recipe.
* _Examples_ may provide speedy solutions or ideas already out there. We encourage people to find solid, working technology, especially open source, that can be emulated or integrated. It's even better when leveraging an open source component provides opportunity for improvement and visiblity to that source project as well as our own.
* _Experiments_ are prototypes that can be applied to the need to gather more factual requirements, determine boundary conditions, weaknesses and strengths in the proposed technology. A good experiment will have an hypothesis and clear instructions for how the experiment should be conducted. It's possible that the Scores Labs team will be live-testing an experiment you propose and create, so help us maximize the learnings and opportunity for success.
