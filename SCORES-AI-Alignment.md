# AI/ML Alignment in SCORES Labs Present and Future
### STATUS: DRAFT
## Basic Principles for Protection of Humanity and The Environment
- Technology we build and utilize needs to be understand in terms of impact
- Autonomous functions need controls and failsafe mechanisms
- Training Data ultimately belongs to Creators of that data, regardless of whether is was intentionally or consciously generated (e.g. physical activity data)

## Best Practices
- Product Goals involving autonomous functions, especially leveraging neural networks and "statistically trained" engines of should be reviewed for Alignment using well-planned Quality Assurance.
- AI Systems must be monitored, and interruptable.

### Suggestions
- Include SCORES student and coach in reviews
- Copy/link relevant statements from platform partners (Salesforce, OpenAI, etc)
