## Reporting
A transcript of the session will be provided for review by developers. Issues, feature requests, and qualitative feedback will be transcribed as tickets and stories for later review and prioritization for upcoming milestones.
If UAT is deemed not to pass, it will be because one of the UX criteria is not met. This will be the automatic priority for development to complete the milestone.
