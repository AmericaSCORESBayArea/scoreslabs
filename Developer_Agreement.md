# Developer Agreement for Volunteers
Scores expects volunteers to adhere to the practice and policy of protecting individual identity, personal information, safety and privacy of students, staff, families, donors, and volunteers.
The specifics of policy in application development and data management are limited by the risks we can identify as well as by regulations in the US, California, the EU, and any agencies with jurisdiction.

## What this Agreement Covers
In order to collaborate effectively, we provide access to developers to private repositories via membership in a Github Team. We also provide access, where appropriate to sandboxes, user interviews, unobfuscated data, and identities of organizations SCORES works with.
Signatories to this Agreement do agree to keep this information and access confidential, not to share credentials, data, or means of reverse-engineering same.

Add your github name, linked to your Github Profile, to this document, to indicate you agree to abide by these terms.
